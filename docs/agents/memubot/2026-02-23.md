Pitch angle: Nova Key comme produit culturel — l'objet NFC qui transforme la pratique spirituelle en acte culturel quotidien. Ces organisations touchent des Juifs culturellement engagés mais non-institutionnellement affiliés — exactement la cible Nova Key. Ask: partenariats de distribution culturelle (Nova Key dans les gift shops des musées, distributions aux participants Limmud, partenariats éditoriaux) + sponsoring d'événements culturels juifs ($5K–$50K) + potentiel co-création de contenu culturel pour la Nova Key (musique yiddish, film juif, littérature).

Ces fondations cherchent exactement ce que DreamNova offre: scalabilité, accessibilité, mesurabilité (chaque tap = un acte de pratique juive documenté).
